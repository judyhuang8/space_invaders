# space_invaders

This was the final project that my partner, Catherine Li, and I made for our Intro to Python (CS 1110) class.

## Prerequisites
- [Python 3.6x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Cornell Extensions](http://cs1110.cs.cornell.edu/docs/)

The folders game2d, Fonts, Sounds, and __pycache__ were provided to us. The images were also provided except for 
linearsprite, linearsprite2, pixelnight, pixelnightsprite, soundOff, soundOn, and test2, which were drawn by Catherine.

## Running the project
Navigate to the directory right outside the space_invaders folder in command shell. Then type 
`python space_invaders`
