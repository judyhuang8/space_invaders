# space_invaders

This was the final project that my partner, Catherine Li, and I made for our Intro to Python (CS 1110) class.

It requires a package provided by Cornell University, http://cs1110.cs.cornell.edu/docs/.
The folders game2d, Fonts, Sounds, and __pycache__ were provided to us. The images were also provided except for 
linearsprite, linearsprite2, pixelnight, pixelnightsprite, soundOff, soundOn, and test2, which were drawn by Catherine.
